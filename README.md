## Introduction
This project utilized advanced data science techniques to identify the top three zip codes in the Baltimore-Washington area, offering the highest potential return on investment (ROI) over a three-year horizon. Using the CRISP-DM methodology ensured a structured and thorough approach, providing reliable insights for potential real estate investors.

## Data Collection and Preparation
The analysis was based on Zillow's zipcode-level time series data.

- We first selected zipcodes that were both:
    - Located in the state of MD.
    - Located in the metro area for either Baltimore or Washington, DC.


- From these selected zipcodes, we analyzed the % increase in home value over the last 5 years were selected.
    - The the top 10 zipcodes that had the highest percent increase were selected.
    - Of these top 10 zipcodes, we decided to eliminate any zipcodes  with an investment cost less than \$1 Million.

## Modeling and Evaluation

Time series SARIMAX models were fit for each of the final zipcodes, using a test period of 24 months, to allow for accurate forecasting 24 months into the future. 
The models were optimized for parameters using cross-validation techniques and their performance was assessed through metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
